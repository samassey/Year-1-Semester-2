Hello World

Case 1: This prints a normal "Hello World" since it was printed as one statement with both words in the same quoted marks.

Case 2: This printed "Hello World" with a space using two different words put together with a comma in between.
	Since there was a comma, you do not need to manually put in the space in between the words.

Case 3: This was two seperate strings combined using a + simble.
	Since the space between the words is not added in, it returns as "HelloWorld".

Case 4: This was two strings being printed on seperate lines with no indication that they were connected. 
	This is the reason it printed "hello" then "World" on the next line. 

Case 5:	Since there are two strings being printed on and the comma comes between them, they will print as "Hello World".
	The comma indicates there will be something else printed next to it on the same line.
