a)- 	The int() function and the ceil() function are very similar. 
	They both will round the number to either whatever the first number is before the decimal or 1 more.

	With the int() function, there will be no decimal after. 
		This means if you do int(2.3) or int(2.7) they will both round to 2.

	With the ceil() function it will round to the number shown before the decimal + 1. This includes a decimal after.
		This means if you do ceil(34.2) or ceil(34.7) they will be rounded to 35.0.
	
	With the round() function, it rounds to either 1 up from the number before the decimal or to that number.
		This means if you do round(2.4) it will be 2, and round(2.7) will be 3.
		this function ignores negative values and will round to the number it would be if it was positive.

b)-	The value of y does not change because it was never re-assigned after it was rounded.
	Since it was not re-assigned, when you print y, it will still be the original value not the rounded value.
