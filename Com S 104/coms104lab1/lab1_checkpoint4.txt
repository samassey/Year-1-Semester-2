A division operator divides two numbers. If the two numbers are int values, it will only return the int factor of the answer.
This means that if you divid 25 by 10 you will only return the value of 2.
If you divide and int by a float, or a float by an int, it will return the divided value as a float.
This means dividing 25 by 10.0 will return 2.5.
The same goes for dividing two float types together. 

The modulus operator gives the remainder of a value after dividing a given amount into that value.
So, if you had 17 % 5 it would divide 17 by 5 the the remainder that can not be divided by 5 is return, in this case 2.
